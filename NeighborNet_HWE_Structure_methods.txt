Method for NeighborNet network in SplitsTree

1. I created a Phylip (.phy) file in R using the "NeighborNet_Teebuilding" script on the kiore-project Git Repository.
	References: Felsenstein, J. (2005). PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package) (3.6). Distributed by the author. https://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html
2. I downloaded and installed SplitsTree4
	Reference: Huson, D. H., & Bryant, D. (2006). Application of Phylogenetic Networks in Evolutionary Studies. Molecular Biology and Evolution, 23(2), 254–267. https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msj030
2. Opened the .phy file in SplitsTree, selected "protein" when promted the data type (to allow for more symbols than just ATCG)
3. Saved as .nex file
	Reference: Maddison DR, Swofford DL, and Maddison WP (1997). NEXUS: An extensible file format for systematic information. Syst Biol 46:590-621
4. Opened .nex file in text viewer, scrolled to line 382 "datatype = protein" and replaced protein with "dna", and then removed all lines after line 2239 "End CHARACTERS". Saved.
5. Re-opened in SplitsTree. Under "Distances", selected HKY85 (which now works), and empirical frequencies.
6. Exported the NeighborNet tree as an image and exported the distance matrix as a tab-delimited text file for use in Mantel test later.

7. Opened the exported genetic distances text file and deleted the "distances as column vector" section at the bottom of the file, as well as the title.


Method for Hardy-Weinberg Analysis and Structure analysis using programs PGDSpider, Arlequin and STRUCTURE

1. I Cleaned up and reformatted the dataset in RStudio to a CONVERT file format (c.f. Data_cleanup script kiore-project repository)
	Reference: Glaubitz J.C. (2004) CONVERT: A user-friendly program to reformat diploid genotypic data for commonly used population genetic software packages. Molecular Ecology Notes 4: 309-310.
2. Downloaded PGDSpider version 2.1.1.5 (May 2018)
	Reference: Lischer HEL and Excoffier L (2012) PGDSpider: An automated data conversion tool for connecting population genetics and genomics programs. Bioinformatics 28: 298-299.
3. Opened PGDSpider and selected the following settings:
	a. Data input file file format: CONVERT; select input file: ratsSNPs_PGDSpyder_input.csv (output from RStudio script stated above)
	b. Data output file file format: ARLEQUIN; select output file: 
	c. Convert Select the type of the data: SNP; Apply
	d. Convert
4. Repeated the above steps again, except: 
	a. Data output file file format: STRUCTURE; select output file:
	b.

At this stage I had an Arlequin input file (*.arp file format) and a STRUCTURE input file (*.str) generated from PGDSpider for use in the Hardy-Weinberg Analysis and the STRUCTURE analysis. Both are on the kiore_project repository.

5. I downloaded Arlequin version 3.5.2.2 (released on 02.08.2015)
	Reference: Excoffier, L. and H.E. L. Lischer (2010) Arlequin suite ver 3.5: A new series of programs to perform population genetics analyses under Linux and Windows. Molecular Ecology Resources. 10: 564-567.
6. Opened Arlequin application and applied the settings and procedures as follows:
	a. File -> Open project -> File: 
	b. Settings -> General settings -> Polymorhism control Allowed missing level per site: 0.6
	c. Settings -> Hardy-Weinberg -> Perform exact test of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium: check mark
	d. Start (then upon completion) View Results
7. Copied the output from the html (or xml) to a text file and saved.
